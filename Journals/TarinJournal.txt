This journal is going to be a lot more scatterbrained

A huge amount of this project was paper prototyping with the team

On the first friday I dealth with making user stories

On the first monday I made a test file full of timestamps that we could use for the project. I also helped the group figure out what the time variables and structs are in C++

On the wednesday before the test, Dan and I sat down for like 45 minutes just redoing our paper prototype and pseudocode. The results if that are in TarinPseudocode.txt, and that's a collaborative effort between he and I. As of this writing (12:30 PM) we are happy with our model of hte project

Friday
With the majority of the program done, my team has set me up on preparing for the future. I've been researching how to do Shell_NotifyIcon popups with the one guy in our team with the glasses (pretty sure his name is Evan)
