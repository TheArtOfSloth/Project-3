The following psuedocode converts a date and time to the number of seconds since the epoch (Jan 1, 1970)

# array to hold number of days in each month
month[12] = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31}

dateToSeconds(year, month, day, hour, minute)
	
	# initialize seconds to start on jan 1 1970 00:00 since chrono starts @ f*cking dec 31 16:00
	seconds = 0 + (8 * 60 * 60)
	
	# return 0 if the year is before the epoch
	if year < 1970
		return 0
	endif
	
	# calculate seconds passed up to entered year	
	for i = 1970 to (year - 1)
		seconds += 31536000
		
		# add a day if leap and non centennial year 
		if (i % 4 == 0) and (i % 100 != 0)
			seconds += 86400
		endif
	
	end loop
	
	# determine if entered year is a leap year (if so, add day to February)
	if (year % 4 == 0) and (year % 100 != 0)
		month[1] = 29
	else
		month[1] = 28
	endif
	
	# calculate seconds passed up to entered month of entered year
	for i = 1 to (month - 1)
		for j = 1 to month[i-1]
			seconds += 86400
		end loop
	end loop
	
	# calculate seconds passed up to entered day of entered month
	for i = 1 to (day - 1)

	end loop
